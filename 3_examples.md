Test-cases about how to perform analysis with [PHONEMeS-ILP](https://github.com/saezlab/PHONEMeS-ILP) for each of it's variants have been provided on the documentation of the package [here](https://github.com/saezlab/PHONEMeS-ILP).

Another step-by-step guide with an example about how we can use the original implementation ([PHONEMeS-stoch](https://github.com/saezlab/PHONEMeS)) in a cluster environment can be found [here](https://github.com/saezlab/PHONEMeS/tree/master/Package/PHONEMeS/inst/doc)
