# PHONEMeS
## Overview

`PHONEMeS` (**PHO**sphorylation **NE**tworks for **M**ass **S**pectrometry) is a method to model signalling networks based on untargeted phosphoproteomics mass spectrometry data and kinase/phosphatase-substrate interactions. 
It is an extension of the Causal Reasoning tool `CARNIVAL` and focuses on identifying deregulated
signaling pathways by linking deregulated phosphorylation sites towards up-stream kinases. Additionally,
it provides prior knowledge networks for kinase-substrate and protein-protein interactions extracted
from `OmnipathR`.

## Installation

To install `PHONEMeS` please run:
```
devtools::install_github('saezlab/PHONEMeS')
```
### Prerequisites

`PHONEMeS` requires the interactive version of IBM Cplex or CBC-COIN solver as the network 
optimiser. The IBM ILOG Cplex is freely available through Academic Initiative [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio). The [CBC](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) solver is open source and freely available
for any user. Alternatively for smaller cases, users can rely on the freely available 
[lpSolve R-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html). 


## Prior versions

The code for the original PHONEMeS package (PHONEMeS v1.0.0) as described in Terfve et al. 2015 can be found in the releases.
For a guide how to run a PHONEMeS analysis using PHONEMeS v1.0.0, please refer to the [documentation](https://saezlab.github.io/PHONEMeS).
